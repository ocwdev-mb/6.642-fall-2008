Lecture notes on laws, approximations, and relations of fluid mechanics. Topics include useful vector operations and identities, time derivative of a fluid volume integral, conservation of mass, conservation of momentum, equations of motion for inviscid fluid, Eulerian description of the fluid interface, surface tension, boundary conditions, Bernoulliâ€™s law, and force on a body in a magnetic fluid.
